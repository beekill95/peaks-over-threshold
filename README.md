# peaks-over-threshold

Implementation of the peaks-over-threshold (POT) algorithm to detect extreme values in time series data,
including Streaming POT (SPOT) and Streaming POT with drift (DSPOT).

The implementation follows the paper: _Siffer, Alban, et al.
"Anomaly detection in streams with extreme value theory."
